# About This Course:
AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health,
and recommend better treatments.As an AI practitioner, you have the opportunity to join in this transformation of modern medicine.
If you're already familiar with some of the math and coding behind AI algorithms, and are eager to develop your skills further to tackle challenges in the healthcare industry,
then this specialization is for you. No prior medical expertise is required! 

# This program will give you practical experience in applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to concrete problems in modern medicine:

- In Course 1, you will create convolutional neural network image classification and segmentation models to make diagnoses of lung and brain disorders. 
- In Course 2, you will build risk models and survival estimators for heart disease using statistical methods and a random forest predictor to determine patient prognosis. 
- In Course 3, you will build a treatment effect predictor, apply model interpretation techniques and use natural language processing to extract information from radiology reports.
